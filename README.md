# NeuralNetClassifier

An 8-layer Convolutional Neural Net Classifier coded using TensorFlow and Keras to solve the Fashion MNIST dataset provided by Zalando (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist). Input is several thousand 28x28 grayscale images of 10 types of fashion items, from high heels to t-shirts and dresses. This classifier is trained using a given dataset, and then is tested by classifying various different images into one of these 10 categories. Model performs with 92% success rate.
